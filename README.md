BLOOD DONATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM


My proposed system will store all medical information in a secure database, accessible by administrators and staff, reducing the time needed to check records. It will also inform users about upcoming donation events, encouraging more participation, and provide all the donation record for donor to view. This system will replace the unreliable booklet method, ensuring records are not lost and improving overall efficiency, making it a critical advancement for healthcare. This system is specifically focused on data collection and storage.
